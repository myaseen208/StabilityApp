Description: Provides tools for Genotype by Environment Interaction (GEI) analysis, using statistical models and visualizations to assess genotype performance across environments. It helps researchers explore interaction effects, stability, and adaptability in multi-environment trials, identifying the best-performing genotypes in different conditions. Which Win Where!
