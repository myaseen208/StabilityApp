## Description

Provides tools for Genotype by Environment Interaction (GEI) analysis,
using statistical models and visualizations to assess genotype
performance across environments. It helps researchers explore
interaction effects, stability, and adaptability in multi-environment
trials, identifying the best-performing genotypes in different
conditions. Which Win Where!
